# React Native Flexbox Demo

This project demonstrates an interactive Flexbox demo built with React Native. Users can adjust various Flexbox properties (such as `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, and more) using sliders and pickers to see real-time layout changes. The app is designed to work on both iOS and Android, with special adjustments for each platform.

## Features

- **Interactive Layout Controls**: Adjust Flexbox properties like direction, wrapping, alignment, growth, and shrinkage.
- **Real-time Preview**: Watch your layout update instantly as you modify settings.
- **Modal Descriptions**: Tap the info icons to get more details about each property.
- **Platform-Specific Styling**: Uses native components for iOS and Android, with tailored behaviors for each.
